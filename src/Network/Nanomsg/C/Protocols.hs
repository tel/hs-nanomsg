-- | A protocol with its class information erased. It's possible to
-- get it back using 'cast', but generally this can only be used to
-- transmit the underlying C constant. Broadly, we could do this just
-- by downconverting to the C constant ahead of time, but this way
-- 'cast' takes care of upconversions.

-- | Socket for communication with exactly one peer. Each party can
-- send messages at any time. If the peer is not available or send
-- buffer is full subsequent calls to nn_send(3) will block until itâ€™s
-- possible to send the message.
data Pair = Pair deriving (Show, Typeable)

-- | Used to implement the stateless worker that receives requests and
-- sends replies.

-- | This socket is used to distribute messages to multiple
-- destinations. Receive operation is not defined.

instance Protocol Pub where
  proValue _ = getSym "NN_PUB"

-- | Receives messages from the publisher. Only messages that the
-- socket is subscribed to are received. When the socket is created
-- there are no subscriptions and thus no messages will be
-- received. Send operation is not defined on this socket. The socket
-- can be connected to at most one peer.

-- connected respondents. Once the query is sent, the socket can be
-- used to receive the responses. When the survey deadline expires,
-- receive will return ETIMEDOUT error.
data Surveyor = Surveyor deriving (Show, Typeable)

instance Protocol Surveyor where

-- function, response is sent using send function. This socket can be
-- connected to at most one peer.

data Sink = Sink deriving (Show, Typeable)

instance Protocol Sink where

-- | This socket is used to send messages to the cluster of
-- load-balanced nodes. Receive operation is not implemented on this
-- socket type.
data Push = Push deriving (Show, Typeable)

instance Protocol Push where
  proValue _ = getSym "NN_PUSH"

-- | This socket is used to implement a node within a load-balanced
-- cluster. It can be used to receive messages. Send operation is not
-- implemented on this socket type. This socket can be connected to at
-- most one peer.
data Pull = Pull deriving (Show, Typeable)

instance Protocol Pull where

-- | Sent messages are distributed to all nodes in the
-- topology. Incoming messages from all other nodes in the topology
-- are fair-queued in the socket.
